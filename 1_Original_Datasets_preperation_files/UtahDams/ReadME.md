These data are shared by Craig Miller at the Utah Division of Water Resources. To look up each Reservoir curve, first find the identifier of that reservoir and then find the curve for that identifier from the spreadsheet

In the Reservoirs/dams shapefile, I deleted nine records because they didnâ€™t have a reservoir name

I complied the data in Sheet 1 in this UtahLargeReservoirs exfel doc from the three separate sources listed below. I joined them using both MS SQL Server. 		
The join between "dbo_ModelResSAC" and "dbo_ModelResData" is based on the shared atttibutes ReservoirID and Model ID in both files		
The join between "dbo_ModelResData" and "Reservoirs" is based on the shared atttibutes Dam number
