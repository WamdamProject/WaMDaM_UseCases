## Generic Excek Workbook template for Input Data
Generally, defining and loading data into a WaMDaM database follows this order.   
**First**, load the controlled vocabulary or leave them blank.   
**Second**, define metadata that will be used for the Attributes and Instances. 
**Third**, define the data structure of Object Types and Attributes.      
**Fourth**, add the master network, scenario, and nodes and links.  
**Fifth**, load data values to each attribute of each Instance. We chose Excel as a generic input data medium which the data sources have to be converted and formatted to fit into a custom Excel workbook that has 17 sheets with fixed column headers for the main tables of input data in WaMDaM.    
Each dataset is prepared to a single workbook one-at-a-time. The Wizard maps all the bridge tablesâ€™ complex relationships and users do not need to know anything about primary or foreign keys.
These sheets are: Organizations&People, Sources&Methods, Datasets&ObjectTypes, Attributes, Networks&Scenarios, Nodes, Links, DualValues, NumericValues, DescriptorValues, SeasonalNumericValues, TimeSeries, TimeSeriesValues, MultiAttributeSeries, ObjectCategory, AttributeCategory, and InstanceCategory. The sheets are related with each other through dropdown lists to help users for example to relate metadata elements to the attributes and data values.
