Many of these are in an old QuattroPro format

1. Dont share this data with others unless agreed by the Bear River Commission (though they told me I can publish them on GitHub with a disclaimer)
2. Always refer to the Bear River Disvions for the original data 
3. The spreadsheets have formulas so be aware of any changes you make
4. I sorted the origianl docs into two folders, one for the Centeral and the second for the Upper Division
