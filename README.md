# WaMDaM_UseCases
Demonstrate how WaMDaM enables systematic data query and comparisons across multiple different models and datasets. 

Follow these four steps to use WaMDaM and enable its use cases on your data

### Application: The Bear River Watershed, Utah 
We demonstrate the WaMDaM design and use cases using twelve data sources and models in the Bear River Watershed which spans three states, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming (Figure below). The Watershed covers an area 3,300 square miles (8,547 square kilometers) and it is the largest source of water to the Great Salt Lake in Utah. 
The Watershed has various unique and overlapping available data provided by the three states, the Bear River Commission, national US datasets, and three existing systems models: Wyoming Model which allocates water based on priority for the upper Bear River Basin, the two model versions of the Lower Bear River which also allocate water on priority. Note that when developers organize their modelâ€™s input data into WaMDaM, models like the Wyoming model become a new source of data. The datasets and models are an example systems water management data of natural and built water supply and demand, infrastructure connectivity, with different data types, networks and scenarios.
