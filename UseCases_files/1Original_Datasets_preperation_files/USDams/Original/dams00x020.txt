  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer portrays major dams of the United States, including Puerto 
      Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The map layer was created by extracting 
      dams 50 feet or more in height, or with a normal storage capacity of 5,000 
      acre-feet or more, or with a maximum storage capacity of 25,000 acre-feet 
      or more, from the 79,777 dams in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers National 
      Inventory of Dams.  This is a replacement for the April 1994 map layer.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in 
      the use of these data.
    Supplemental_Information: 
      In the online National Atlas of the United States Map Maker, at scales 
      smaller than 1:4,850,000 the data is thinned for display purposes.  For
      scales between 1: 4,850,000 and 1:22,000,000, dams are only shown if they 
      have a height of 500 feet or more, or a normal storage capacity of 50,000 
      acre-feet or more, or a maximum storage capacity of 250,000 acre-feet or 
      more (1280 dams).  At scales smaller than 1:22,000,000, dams are only 
      shown if they have a height of 5000 feet or more, or a normal storage 
      capacity of 500,000 acre-feet or more, or a maximum storage capacity of 
      2,500,000 acre-feet or more (290 dams).

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: 
        The full National Inventory of Dams (NID) was downloaded from the NID 
        web site in shapefile format and loaded into ArcView.  Using an 
        ArcView query, major dams were selected and placed in a new shapefile.  
        Major dams were defined as dams with a height of 50 feet or more, or 
        with a normal storage capacity of 5,000 acre-feet or more, or with a 
        maximum storage capacity of 25,000 acre-feet or more.  (The 
        International Committee on Large Dams considers dams over 50 feet to be 
        large dams.  The USGS Water Resources Division considers large 
        reservoirs to be those with a normal storage capacity of 5,000 acre-feet 
        or more, or with a maximum storage capacity of 25,000 acre-feet or 
        more.)  

        One dam in Guam and one dam in the Trust Territories were deleted.  
        Eighty-nine dams without valid latitude/longitude coordinates were also 
        deleted.  

        Because the text fields contained entries in a mix of formats, some in 
        all capitals and some in capitals and lower-case, all text entries were 
        changed to all capitals.

        Some dams were missing county attribute values.  The appropriate values 
        were determined by comparing the dam locations to the Atlas-Cnty file.  
        One dam was deleted because it was described as being in Maryland but 
        had coordinates that placed it in Virginia.
 
        Invalid values for owner type (197 records), dam type (10 records), and 
        year completed (3 records) were changed to blanks to indicate that the 
        values are unknown.  The attribute Purposes contained some invalid 
        codes; these were removed but valid codes and duplicate codes were 
        retained.  Thirty-nine records contained a value of -9.9 for Nid_height.  
        The appropriate value for each record was determined by looking at the 
        dam height, structural height, and hydraulic height values in the source 
        data.  One invalid value for hazard was changed to U to indicate that 
        the hazard potential is unknown.

        The shape file was converted to an ArcInfo coverage and then converted 
        to NAD 83 for display purposes.  The result was then converted back to 
        shapefile format.

        height, regardless of storage capacity or which has a storage capacity 
        at maximum water storage elevation not in excess of fifteen acre-feet, 
        regardless of height, unless such barrier, due to its location or other 
        physical characteristic, is likely to pose a significant threat to human
