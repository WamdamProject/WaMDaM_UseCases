Model input: reservoir capacity and evaporation, gage station node head-flow, historic node diversions, ImportExport for each node
Model output: reach-gains and losses for each “reach” or sub-reach. Mass balance estimates based on gage station readings, historic diversions, and return flows (a fraction of diversion) 
Return flow for each sub-node (similar to diversions) or major reach. I should not use any of the data for major reaches because these reaches are virtual. The real reaches are the sub-reaches. Water flow at each sub-node
The final results are
