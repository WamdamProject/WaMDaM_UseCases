High-level, the elevation at Hyrum is measured by a pressure transducer, and the storage is computed from the elevation (your assumption is accurate).

I've attached the elevation-storage table for "Total Storage", which in our terminology means all the water in the reservoir.  The values in our database are actually "Live Storage", which is all the water that can be evacuated from the reservoir by gravity, or all water above the lowest outlet inlet (elevation 4629.6 feet).  To match the table to the database values, ignore all values below elevation 4629.6 feet and subtract 3012 acre-feet ("Dead Storage") from the storage for all other elevations.  And just so you know, the storage computation we use is a computation (kind of complicated), not a lookup of the table values, so the table may differ very slightly from the data in our database.
